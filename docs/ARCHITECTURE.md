# Architecture

## Stack

TypeScript + Vite, vanilla DOM (no framework), Canvas 2D for effects, Web Audio for sound.
Vitest for the engine and game models, Playwright (Pixel 7 viewport) for end-to-end flows.

Why web over a game engine: the app is a grid, panels and text plus a light-show layer. A PWA
installs on Android without a store, the same TS engine runs in the browser and in Node (pack
generation, tests), and the test loop is fast. The effects that make it feel like Tetris Effect —
additive particles, a blurred nebula, synthesized music — are cheap in Canvas 2D and Web Audio.

## Engine

- `CellId` 0..80 row-major; user-facing names `r{row}c{col}` (1-based). Houses have flat ids
  0..26 (rows, cols, boxes). Candidates are `Uint16Array(81)` bitmasks (bits 1–9).
- **Exact solver** — bitmask backtracking, minimum-remaining-values, hidden-single forcing, and
  cage pruning (a cell may only take digits that appear in a combination completing its cage).
  Used for uniqueness and validation, never for hints.
- **Logical solver** — asks techniques in rating order, applies the first step found, repeats.
  Every step is a sound deduction. Techniques flag `killerOnly`, `classicOnly` and
  `assumesUnique` (unique rectangles, BUG+1); the latter are excluded when a solve is used as a
  uniqueness proof.
- **Steps** carry structured `explain` data, `focus` (where to look), `marks` (candidate roles:
  place / elim / key / alt / on / off / digit), `links` (chain arrows), `sources` (digits that
  justify a single) and `virtualCages` (45-rule cages). Templates in `hints/` turn `explain` into
  the four rung texts; the board turns the rest into visuals. Square names in those texts are
  coloured by `ui/cell-refs.ts`; each board computes the colours for the visible rungs itself
  (`refColors`), and the hint sheet asks the board for the same map, so text and rings always
  agree.
- **Hints** reason from the board (basic candidates), never from the player's notes, and always
  end in a placement: `sudokuHint` runs the solver ahead a few placements, traces each one's
  candidate dependencies back through the steps before it (digit-aware: a hidden single of 7 only
  needs earlier eliminations of 7 in its house; arithmetic placements need none), and picks the
  placement with the fewest. A direct probe first asks every placing technique (singles, cage
  last cell, 45-rule sums) about the board itself. Up to three steps become `hint.prior`, walked
  through in the "why" rung; longer routes are taught in rounds of three (a hint with no
  placement). Everything a hint rules out goes into `SudokuGame.known` (saved) and back in as
  `HintInput.known`, so rounds build on each other. `hintMarks` is the one list of squares a step
  hint pencils — the board draws ghosts there, and applying a round writes `shownCandidates`
  (Auto notes' candidates, less `known`) into the same squares. Notes are only checked for digits
  that are impossible (`impossibleNotes`); auto-clear on placement removes exactly those (cage
  sums included), so notes a round wrote never trip the check.

### Generation
- Classic: random solved grid → dig 180°-symmetric pairs while the exact solver says unique →
  logical solve → keep when the grade matches the target difficulty.
- Killer: random solved grid → grow cages (no repeated digit; size mix per difficulty) →
  logical solve with no uniqueness-assuming techniques. A complete solve *proves* uniqueness.
  If the solver gets stuck, split the stuck cage with the most open candidates and retry. This is
  far faster than exact counting on loose layouts (which can take millions of nodes), and it
  guarantees every killer puzzle is hintable end to end. Single-cell cages are capped per
  difficulty.
- Queens: random valid queen placement → grow regions from the queens with per-difficulty region
  styles → exact uniqueness repair → logical grade.

## UI

- Screens are plain objects `{ el, destroy() }` mounted by `App`. `App.play` destroys the current
  screen *before* building the next so a stale autosave can't overwrite a new game.
- Game models emit events (`place`, `complete`, `solved`, …); play screens translate events into
  board animations, particles, callouts, sound and haptics. Models never touch the DOM.
- The sudoku board is DOM cells (crisp text, accessible `gridcell`s) under an SVG overlay
  (grid lines, cage outlines traced from cell boundaries and inset at corners, tints, hint
  layer). Killer cage outlines are closed polygons so they can be animated (light runs around a
  completed cage).
- Effects: a low-resolution nebula canvas stretched by CSS (free blur, cheap on phones) and a
  full-screen additive particle canvas using pre-rendered glow sprites (no `shadowBlur`); the
  particle loop sleeps when idle. Effects level scales particle counts and disables ambient motion.
- Sound: see the design notes at the top of `src/ui/audio/synth.ts`.

## Performance

Hints run synchronously on the main thread; the logical solver's step search is milliseconds on
typical positions. Pack generation runs in Node across CPU cores.
