/**
 * Mode-independent hint shapes. Sudoku (classic + killer) and Queens both produce hints as a
 * four-rung ladder so the UI can render every hint the same way:
 *
 *   1 where — which part of the board to look at (no technique named)
 *   2 what  — the technique name and a one-line nudge
 *   3 why   — the full reasoning, with cells and candidates highlighted
 *   4 do    — what applying the step changes
 *
 * Rung 0 (mistakes / bad notes) is expressed as a hint of kind "mistake" or "notes" with the same
 * ladder, so it climbs the same way.
